Makefile
========
Since this program is not portable at all, there is no configure script and
no options.

Edit Makefile and specify the path to your C-compiler!
Common values are
CC=/usr/vac/bin/xlc
or
CC=gcc

Compile with
$ make

When you see compiler errors, check the compiler version!

Copy the binaries to your Nagios libexec directory (e.g. /usr/local/nagios/libexec)
The binaries do not need root permission, all run fine with any unprivileged user.

Binaries
========
The included binaries were built on AIX 6.1 TL9 with xlC 12.1.0.21 and were tested
on AIX 6.1, AIX 7.1 and AIX 7.2. They are included for convenience, but there
is no guarantee that they work on all AIX systems. It is expected that the binaries
will also work on AIX 7.3.
To compile your own binaries please do a "make clean; make"!

Tested compilers
================
IBM xlC 8.0 or newer
 bos.adt.base and bos.adt.include are dependencies of the compiler

gcc 4.8.2 (from perzl.org) was tested on AIX 5.3 TL12, 6.1 TL7 and 7.1 TL2.
 Older gcc versions probably work too.
 Make sure to install an OS-compatible gcc version!
 If you see compiler errors in system header files (like /usr/include/secattr.h),
 then you probably installed the wrong gcc version (e.g. gcc for AIX 5.3 on AIX 6.1)
 It might be necessary to install the system header files from the filesets
 bos.adt.base and bos.adt.include!

Operating systems
=================
The monitors will compile and run on AIX 5.3 TL6 or higher, AIX 6.1, AIX 7.1 and AIX 7.2.
The perfstat pool API is not present in earlier versions and there are also hardware
dependencies (see below).

Hardware
========
The monitor can be compiled on any AIX hardware which runs a supported AIX version.
It might be possible, that the monitor won't run because of PowerVM restrictions
or LPAR settings. See README for details

The monitor will run on Power5 or newer CPUs (tested on Power6, 7 and 8).

2 types of LPARs are supported:
- shared processor LPAR
- dedicated donating LPAR (only entitlement monitors)

It is not possible to monitor dedicated or full partition LPARs with this monitor
because it's no entitlement or pool data available there from the perfstat API.
